// - An API (implemented using the other APIs) that appears synchronous, but may throw if a placeholder's content is needed but isn't available.

// Additionally we would will need to augment Snapshot with enough history to be able to resolve rebased anchors, and give it a nicer API,
// Probably something more like TreeNodeHandle and/or the non-mutating subset of TreeNode.

/**
 * Editing Operation that can be performed as part of a transaction.
 * Runs with Snapshot Isolation.
 *
 * A call to a particular command makes an edit at some level of abstraction.
 * The command performs this edit using the CommandContext to either make edits directly to the tree, or via nested commands.
 *
 * Merge resolution always starts with the low level tree edits.
 * When an Edit is applied, it produces result based on the `ConstraintEffect`s indicating how the edit went.
 * If the resulting result is one of the `Retry` versions, then the application may
 * try to create a new Edit by rerunning the commands that produced the original edit.
 *
 * Unlike the low level tree edits, commands are not required to be deterministic since only one client will rerun the command,
 * and the resulting low level deterministic tree changes will be packed up into an Edit for the other clients to apply.
 *
 * When retrying an edit, the application will be provided with a Command tree (now shown in this APi prototype),
 * and can replay it as the desired abstraction level. Note that the application might not have the required commands present,
 * or they might have changed somewhat since the command was originally ran.
 * An example app policy for this could be to apply it at the lowest level that is valid (raising the level every time it detects invalidity).
 * The other extreme would be to replay it at the highest possible level, lowering the abstraction only if the command is unavailable or invalid.
 * There are also priority based options (where some levels of abstraction could be preferred regardless of if they are higher or lower).
 * Eventually we expect to settle on a single policy that will work well for all apps and provide that as a library.
