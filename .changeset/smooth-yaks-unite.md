Publish API for creating events as alpha.

Export `createEmitterMinimal` and related types as `@alpha`.
See `createEmitterMinimal`'s documentation for example usage.
These APIs allow users to implement events in the same style `SharedTree` does.
In the future they may be published as a standalone event library is there is sufficient demand.
